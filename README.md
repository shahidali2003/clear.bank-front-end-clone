🚀 Frontend Clone of Clear.Bank 💻
I’m excited to share a project I’ve been working on recently — a frontend clone of Clear.Bank using HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS. 🎨✨

🔗 Tech Stack:

HTML for the structure
CSS & Tailwind CSS for the styling design
Key Features:
✅ Tailored for a sleek, professional user experience 👨‍💻

Why Tailwind CSS?
Tailwind CSS allows for fast and easy development with a utility-first approach, making it simpler to customize and adapt the UI. It’s efficient and scalable, perfect for projects like this!

🛠️ Working on this helped me improve my CSS architecture skills and experiment with Tailwind’s components and flexibility. I learned a lot about responsive grids and the importance of UI consistency.

Feel free to connect or DM me for collaboration opportunities or feedback. Always open to learning and growing! 🚀
